Sunset, Broadway are all the streets I like
Neon billboards that make me feel alive
I don't think they take me serious
Normal life makes me delirious

Ever think of changin your name
For all the attention you could gain (gain)
Has anybody told you your vain
Bow down bow down the sinners have the floor

Why are we just junkies for fame
Why because it's burned in our brains
When we wake up and we need it to stay up
You know I like it I've always been a junkie for fame
Why are we just junkies for fame why
Get rich get high get drunk on your desire
Stand back relax now watch me start a fire
I don't think they take me serious
Normal life makes me delirious

Ever think of changin your name
For all the attention you could gain (gain)
Has anybody told you your vain
Bow down bow down the sinners have the floor
